/*
    Template Method Coding Exercise
    Imagine a typical collectible card game which has cards representing creatures. Each creature has two values: 
    Attack and Health. Creatures can fight each other, dealing their Attack damage, thereby reducing their opponent's 
    health.
    
    The class CardGame implements the logic for two creatures fighting one another. However, the exact mechanics of 
    how damage is dealt is different:
    
    TemporaryCardDamage : In some games (e.g., Magic: the Gathering), unless the creature has been killed, its health 
    returns to the original value at the end of combat.
    PermanentCardDamage : In other games (e.g., Hearthstone), health damage persists.
    You are asked to implement classes TemporaryCardDamageGame  and PermanentCardDamageGame  that would allow us to 
    simulate combat between creatures.
    
    Some examples:
    
    With temporary damage, creatures 1/2 and 1/3 can never kill one another. With permanent damage, second creature 
    will win after 2 rounds of combat.
    With either temporary or permanent damage, two 2/2 creatures kill one another.
