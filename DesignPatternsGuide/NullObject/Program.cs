/*
    Null Object Coding Exercise
    In this example, we have a class Account  that is very tightly coupled to an ILog ... it also breaks SRP 
    by performing all sorts of weird checks in SomeOperation().
    Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to implement a NullLog  class that can be fed into an Account  
    and that doesn't throw any exceptions.
