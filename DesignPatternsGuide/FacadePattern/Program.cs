/*
    Facade Coding Exercise
    A magic square is a square matrix whose rows, columns and diagonals add up to the same value.
    I have built a system that helps us construct magic squares, but it's a little bit complicated. At the moment, 
    it is composed of three classes:
    1 - Generator makes an array of random digits (suitably constrained) of a particular length. 
        You can use this generator several times to build a square matrix of required size.
    2 - Splitter splits a 2D square matrix into several lists containing all rows, all columns and all diagonals.
    3 - Verifier ensures that, given a list of lists, every single list adds up to the same value.
    
    Using all of the above, please implement a MagicSquareGenerator facade that uses all these three components 
    to generate a valid magic square of the required size.
