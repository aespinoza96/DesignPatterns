/*
  Bridge Coding Exercise
  You are given an example of an inheritance hierarchy which results in Cartesian-product duplication.
  Please refactor this hierarchy, giving the base class Shape  a constructor that takes an interface IRenderer  defined as
  interface IRenderer
  {
    string WhatToRenderAs { get; }
  }
  as well as VectorRenderer  and RasterRenderer  classes. Each implementer of the Shape  abstract class should have a constructor that takes an IRenderer  such that, subsequently, each constructed object's ToString()  operates correctly, for example,
  new Triangle(new RasterRenderer()).ToString() // returns "Drawing Triangle as pixels"
